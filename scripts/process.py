Every call resolves the program to its full path, passes a list of arguments (never a shell string), closes stdin and
applies a timeout. Repository checks import from here instead of ``subprocess``, so the lint exception for starting a

    Parameters
    ----------
    program : str
        Program name resolved on PATH, or a path to an executable.
    args : Sequence[str]
        Arguments passed as a list; no shell is involved.
    cwd : Path, optional

    timeout : float
        Seconds before the program is stopped.

    env : Mapping[str, str], optional
        Complete environment for the program; the current environment when omitted.
    capture : bool
        Capture stdout and stderr as text; when false they stream to this process's output, for long-running jobs whose
        logs must reach the container log collector.

    subprocess.CalledProcessError
        ``check`` is true and the program exits non-zero.
    TimeoutExpired
